            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Venushka Perampalam and my <abbr title="Date of Birth">DOB</abbr> is on the 27<sup>th</sup> of <em>February</em>. I live in Sri Lanka, Colombo city which is the capital and the largest city of Sri Lanka. Hoping to come to Canada in the next couple of months. My native language is Sinhala and I can speak English as well. I learned graphic designing in my home country and have few years of work experience as a designer. The main reason why I chose this course is because of the diversity of the course content. This will open up wide career opportunities, as most subjects are new to me. In addition, this is the first time I will be moving away from home, so it will be a new life experience for me.</p>

            <p>My hobbies include drawing, water-coloring, travelling and baking. Furthermore, I would love to learn about coding, digital illustrating, calligraphy, and lettering in the future. My career goal would be to work in a corporate field while adapting to fresh and innovative design trends, as it will give me the ability to engage with experienced people, which will help me to gain more life experience, independence, and a better idea of the type of career path I want to follow in the future.</p>
